Hello, I'm Alyshai! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm currently a **Consultant, Analytics and Insights at [Covergent Business Technologies](https://convergentbt.com/)** where I apply my technical skills to solve real-world problems and provide data-driven insights.

ðŸ˜„ I have a Masters in Computer Science from FAST NUCES Islamabad, where I conducted research in the field of machine learning. I have also been a content creator, digital account manager, and writer. I enjoy learning, growing, and implementing new ideas.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to write better code in Python and become more tech-savvy.

âš¡ When I'm not working, I can be found exploring new food spots or playing DOTA 2 or Command & Conquer: Generals â€“ Zero Hour.
