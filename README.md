Hey there 👋 I'm <b>Alyshai</b> — data storyteller, analytics nerd, and proud overthinker 🧠✨  

🎓 I’m currently a **Computing Research Graduate Assistant** at <b>[Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu/)</b>, where my work lives at the intersection of **AI, learning analytics, and equity in education**.  
I’m exploring how multimodal data — from classroom discourse to student reflections — can help instructors create more inclusive, participatory learning environments.  

💼 Before diving into research, I worked as a **Consultant, Data Analytics & Insights**.
There, I turned cloud data chaos (Azure, GCP, AWS) into clean, insightful dashboards and analytics strategies that powered smarter business decisions.  

💡 The current project I am working on uses machine learning, observation data, and surveys to uncover how equity shows up (or doesn’t) in real classrooms.  

🌱 These days I’m deep into **machine learning**, **learning analytics**, and **data engineering**, exploring how to make machines not just crunch numbers — but actually help humans learn better.  

🎮 Outside the world of data, I’m usually searching for the best food spots or reliving my gamer era with **DOTA 2** and **Command & Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour**.  

☕ Also: coffee is my favorite algorithm for productivity.  

📫 Always open to chat about **data, learning science, or creative analytics** — just don’t ask me to pick between Power BI and Tableau. 😉
